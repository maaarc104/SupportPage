                <p>You have an exceptional breadth of options to control your character within Warzone with countless tweaks, configuration changes, sensitivity toggling, and masses of other minor elements to finely tune. Here, we’ll offer a quick overview of the different settings you can fiddle with, most of which can be changed before and during gameplay. Plus, we’ll go over all the basic controls and features of your heads-up display (HUD).</p>

        <p>When using a keyboard and mouse in Warzone on default settings, its buttons have the following commands (these settings can be adjusted</p><p>in the Controller Settings Options menu):</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>W, A, S, D</b> – Movement: Use these keys to move forward (W), left (A), backwards (S), and right (D).</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Mouse</b> – Aim/Look: Push this stick in any direction to have your Operator look around or aim a weapon.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Left Click</b> – Aim Down Sight: This narrows the field of view to focus on a specific target for more precise gunfights. Additionally, ADS zooms </p><p>into your equipped sights (reticle or native). Pressing Left Click also allows you to mount your weapon if you’re close to a wall, windowsill, or </p><p>other scenery that allows it. Specific settings for Weapon Mount Activation can be configured in the Options Menu, but the default is ADS + Melee.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Right Click</b> – Fire Weapon: This expels projectiles from your weapon’s chamber. Pay attention to your weapon’s firing mode – single, burst, or </p><p>fully-automatic – as you may need to press this trigger multiple times for continuous firing.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>F</b> – Use: If you need to access a context-sensitive object (like opening a door instead of charging through it), press this key.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>R</b> – Reload: Low on ammo? Press this button to reload a weapon.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Space</b> – Jump/Stand/Mantle/Cut Parachute: Jump across gaps, mantle over lower objects such as barriers or windowsills, and climb certain scenery </p><p>using this button. The height of your jump may be influenced by your speed and the number of successive jumps you’ve taken. During infiltration,</p><p> this is the button you press to open  your parachute, which is crucial to your survival.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>C</b> – Crouch/Slide When moving under normal circumstances, you tap this button to crouch. If you’re sprinting and hold this button, you’ll slide into a</p><p> crouch or a prone position if you keep holding the button (on the default sliding controls).</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Left Ctrl</b> – Prone: Tap this key to go prone, lowering your center of gravity in order to do actions such as crawling under objects.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Left Shift</b> – Sprint/Tactical Sprint/Steady Aim Freelook: If you’re maneuvering, tap while you move to sprint, or tap twice quickly while moving to</p><p> tactical sprint (which causes you to move more quickly than a sprint, but with your weapon pointed up and held in one hand, lengthening the time it</p><p> takes to aim and engage the gun).</p><p> If you’re using a sniper rifle, tap this to take an inhale of breath, and steady your aim by a significant amount. While infiltrating or parachuting, tap </p><p>this to switch from</p><p>a first to a third-person perspective while parachuting; this allows you to increase your peripheral vision which can help you reach a landing spot, or </p><p>see enemies landing close to, or behind you.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>1 or Mouse Wheel Up</b> – Next Weapon: Swap to your next weapon by either pressing the 1 key or rolling the mouse wheel up.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>2 or Mouse Wheel Down</b> – Previous Weapon: Swap back to a previous weapon by either pressing the 2 key or rolling the mouse wheel down. </p><p>Depending on settings, using the Next or Previous Weapon commands will “wrap” weapon selection around or stop at the first and last weapons in</p><p> a loadout.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Mouse Button 4 or Z</b> – Mount: Press this to mount a weapon if you’re close to a wall, windowsill, or other scenery that allows this.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>B</b> – Fire Mode: Utilizing this function when using a weapon that offers multiple firing modes – i.e. an assault rifle that has both fully-automatic and </p><p>burst fire modes – changes the fire mode of that weapon.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Mouse Button 5 or E</b> – Melee: Pistol whip, strike, or otherwise bludgeon a foe at close quarters with the melee attack or hold to attempt a</p><p> Finishing Move when attacking an unsuspecting foe from behind. You can also melee doors open, too.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Q</b> – Tactical Equipment: This utilizes the tactical equipment that you’ve found; usually a non-lethal Grenade, but a Stim or Heartbeat Sensor are also </p><p>options.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>G/Mouse Wheel Press</b> – Lethal Equipment: This utilizes the lethal equipment that you’ve found; which ranges from Proximity Mines to C4, to a </p><p>Throwing Knife, to a good old-fashioned Frag Grenade.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>X</b> – Use Field Upgrade: Whenever you find an in-game Field Upgrade, i.e. a Trophy System, press this key to activate it.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>3/K</b> – Killstreak: This engages a Killstreak that you found in game. Tap right to launch a Killstreak or hold right to open a radial menu and select</p><p> a Killstreak if you have more than one available.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>4</b> – Equip Armor: Pressing this button makes your Operator equip an Armor Plate, if you have one.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>T</b> – Ping/Gesture/Spray: Pressing this button will ping a 3D position in the environment and put a marker on the map for you and your squad. </p><p>Holding it enables a chosen hand gesture or spray in Warzone. Use them to:</p>
        <br>
        <p>Gesture: Direct squadmates without a microphone.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Spray: Brighten up your immediate surroundings.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>D-pad Left</b> – Fire Mode: Utilize this function when using a weapon that offers multiple firing modes to change the fire mode – i.e. an assault rifle</p><p> that has both fully-automatic and burst fire modes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>~ – Drop: Do you have extra ammo or Cash to share with a squadmate? Press this to open the Drop menu and share those supplies.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Tab– Tac Map: Tap this to see the entire in-game map. Along with a coordinates chart and a topographical version of Verdansk, you can also see</p><p> where your squadmates are, where the collapse is closing in on, and icons that represent Contracts, Vehicles, and more. These icons can be toggled</p><p>on or off with a simple  on-screen button prompt.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>F3/F2</b>– Pause/Dismiss Pause Menu: This brings up or dismisses your Pause menu. In the Warzone menu, you can see your squad’s score, including</p><p> damage dealt, revives, kills, and Cash. In addition, you can access social options and enter the robust Options menu to change every aspect of control </p><p>scheme.</p>
