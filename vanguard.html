    <h1>GETTING STARTED IN CALL OF DUTY®: VANGUARD:</h1><h1>CONTROLS AND SETTINGS</h1>        
</div>

<div class="p1">
        <p>Those who have downloaded the Beta will be able to cross-launch into it via Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War,</p><p> Call of Duty: Warzone™, or Modern Warfare® from the main menu for any of those games.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Simply move your joystick or mouse to the far left “blade” of this main menu, and you will be able to launch into</p><p> the Vanguard Beta. Alternatively, you can launch into the application directly without needing to go into any of</p><p> the three full Call of Duty experiences.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As for what this Beta includes… this is what you need to know:</p>

    </div>


<div class="p2">
        <p>
        Following its installation, start up the Beta application and follow the first button prompt to be taken through a</p><p> quick first-time settings and agreements menu series.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In addition to ensuring you have an Activision Account – don’t worry, one can be created here if you don’t have</p><p> one – and suggesting that you set up Two-Factor Authentication, this menu series is important for checking the</p><p> following:</p>
        
        <p>·        Your screen’s brightness is set to optimal levels.</p>
        <p>·        The sound quality and levels are appropriate for your listening environment or means.</p>
        
        <p>·        Certain accessibility settings – e.g. subtitles and
        color-blind friendly HUD palettes – </p><p>are enabled and customized to your condition or preference.</p>
        
        <p>·        A selection of important controller options – e.g. button and stick layouts – are to your preference</p>
        <br>
        <p>You can always visit the settings menu before, during, or after a match to readjust these basic and more complex</p><p> options, such as Automatic Sprint, Deadzone sliders, Motion Blur within the world, and even Hit Marker Sound</p><p> Effects (e.g. Classic, for those Call of Duty veterans who want some nostalgia).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Following that menu, you will be ready to play via the main lobby. Those who start Vanguard for the first time will</p><p> be at Private, Level 1. This means certain options, such as Custom Loadouts within the Weapons submenu, are</p><p> unavailable. In addition, you will not be able to choose a specific Operator, Calling Card, or Emblem at all within</p><p> the Beta – within the full game, these options will be available, but have limited choices at Level 1.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All that leaves, then, is the Play menu; in addition to Featured Playlists that are curated by Sledgehammer Games</p><p> for specific map, mode, ruleset, and/or intensity combinations, you can jump straight into a match through Quick</p><p>Play, which offers some customization for what can be played through filters. Select the “Filter” Button next to the</p><p> main Quick Play option, and another menu pops up – here, you can choose what exact game modes you want to</p><p> play, as well as your Combat Pacing.</p>

            <p><b>Combat Pacing – Defining Your Vanguard Multiplayer Experience Beyond Modes</b></p>

            <p>New to Vanguard, Combat Pacing allows players more choice in how they experience Multiplayer.</p>
            <p>Within the Quick Play filters menu, the following Combat Pacing options are available:</p>
            <br>

            <p>·        All. By choosing this preference, expect a mix of all the following Combat Pacing types.</p>

            <p>·        Tactical: These are the lobbies that franchise veterans know well. This is the experience that you're used to</p><p> with classic Call of Duty combat timing. Tactical Combat Pacing is always 6v6.</p>

            <p>·        Assault: Balanced combat pacing that gives you enough room to breath and a lot of targets to kill. A middle</p> <p>ground between Tactical and Blitz. In Beta Weekend 1, player counts will vary between 20-28 players.</p>

            <p>·        Blitz: High-action lobbies where the intensity is cranked up to frenetic levels. Prepare for plenty of combat</p><p>when choosing to join a Blitz. In Beta Weekend 1, player counts will vary between 28-48 players.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Once you choose your desired modes and Combat Pacing – or selected a Featured Playlist – you will enter your</p><p> first match, choose from a few pre-set Default Loadouts, and play.</p>

            <h2>Modes of the Beta</h2>
            
        </div>

    <div class="p4">
            <p>Outside of Combat Pacing, Vanguard Multiplayer’s Quick Play menu allows players to choose what exact mode they want to play. Here is what is available during the Beta’s first weekend, starting with an all-new mode arriving on the first Saturday of the Beta:</p>

            <p><b>Patrol</b></p>

            <p>Capture and hold the moving zone to earn points for your team.</p>

            <p>Call of Duty veterans can think of Patrol as Hardpoint with a “Patrol Zone” that moves along the map rather than changing positions every minute. However, this brand-new mode is more than just a Hardpoint variant, especially when discussing its meta (most effective tactics available).</p>

            <p>Patrol pits two teams against each other in a fight for a single “Patrol Zone,” a scoring zone indicated with a bright beam of light on the ground, several downwards-facing chevrons, and a “Capture” icon on the HUD and in-game world that is initially locked at the start of the match.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="patt">
            <img src="images\pat.png">
        </div>

        <div class="p5">
            <p>In addition to Patrol, these modes are also available in the Beta:</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Search & Destroy</b></p>

                <p>Defend and destroy the objective. No respawning.</p>

                <p><b>Team Deathmatch</b></p>

                <p>Use teamwork to eliminate players on the opposing team. The first team to reach the score limit wins.</p>

                <p><b>Domination</b></p>

                <p>Capture and defend the designated position to gain points</p>

                <p><b>Kill Confirmed</b></p>

                <p>Recover dog tags to score for your team and deny enemy scores.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Separate to Quick Play, players can experience Champion Hill, as seen in the PlayStation Alpha, through separate Duo, Trio and – making its first appearance here in the Beta – Solo Featured Playlists.</p>

                <p>Each of these three squad sizes affects Champion Hill’s “meta” significantly, and a new Weapon Set – Weapon Set 3, which combines weaponry from the sets seen in the Alpha – offers a whole new way to play this easy to drop in, rewarding to win mode.</p>
